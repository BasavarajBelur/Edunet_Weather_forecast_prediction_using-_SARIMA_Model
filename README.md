# SARIMA MODEL 
The SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model is an extension of the ARIMA model that accounts for seasonality in time series data. It is widely used in forecasting tasks where data shows patterns that repeat over regular intervals, such as in weather forecasting.
#1. Overview of the Project:
The goal is to forecast weather data (e.g., temperature, rainfall) using the SARIMA model, then visualize the results using Streamlit. Users will input their desired forecast parameters (e.g., forecast horizon) and see the forecasted weather along with historical data and error metrics.
#2. Steps to Build the Application:
Step 1: Install Required Libraries
To get started, you will need to install several Python libraries:

- pandas and numpy for data manipulation.
- matplotlib for plotting graphs.
- statsmodels for the SARIMA model.
- streamlit to create the web app.
- 
#2. Data Collection:
Obtain historical weather data for a specific location (city, region, or country) from sources like:
National Meteorological Institutes
Public weather datasets (e.g., Kaggle, NOAA)
The data should be cleaned and formatted, ensuring that the time series is continuous (i.e., no missing dates or irregular intervals).

#3. Data Preprocessing:
Time Series Setup: Ensure the data is indexed with a proper datetime format (e.g., daily, hourly).
Handling Missing Data: If there are missing values, fill them using interpolation or remove rows with gaps.
Data Transformation: For non-stationary data (where mean and variance change over time), you may need to:
Differencing: Use differencing (first or second order) to remove trends.
Log Transformation: In some cases, applying a logarithm can stabilize variance.
Seasonality: Identify and separate any seasonal patterns. For example, weather data may exhibit yearly patterns (higher temperatures in summer, more rainfall during certain months, etc.).

#4. Model Selection (SARIMA Configuration):
SARIMA involves several parameters: (p, d, q) x (P, D, Q, S), where:
(p, d, q): Non-seasonal parameters (Autoregressive order, differencing order, and Moving Average order).
(P, D, Q, S): Seasonal components (Seasonal autoregressive order, seasonal differencing, seasonal moving average order, and the length of the seasonal cycle, such as 12 for monthly data).
S: Seasonal period (e.g., 12 for monthly data with yearly seasonality).
Identify the Best Parameters: Use statistical methods like the ACF (Auto-Correlation Function) and PACF (Partial Auto-Correlation Function) plots to help identify values for p, q, P, Q, and seasonal period (S).
Grid Search: Experiment with different parameter combinations to find the optimal configuration by evaluating model performance on validation data.

#5. Model Building and Fitting:
Train the SARIMA Model: Fit the SARIMA model to the historical weather data, incorporating seasonal and non-seasonal components.
Model Evaluation: Use performance metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) to evaluate how well the model fits the data.
Residual Analysis: Analyze the residuals (errors) to check for patterns, ensuring no structure is left unexplained by the model.

#6. Forecasting:
Once the SARIMA model is trained, use it to forecast future weather values. This could be a few days, weeks, or months ahead, depending on the data granularity.
Confidence Intervals: Along with the point forecasts, provide confidence intervals to express the uncertainty of predictions.

#7. Model Validation:
Test Set: Use a hold-out test set (or cross-validation) to validate the accuracy of the forecasts on unseen data.
Compare with Actual Data: Compare the forecasts with the actual observed weather data (if available) to assess the model's performance.

#8. Deployment:
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for live forecasting. This can be automated to update forecasts on a regular basis (daily/weekly/monthly).
Visualization: Create a dashboard or graphs (like line plots, error plots, etc.) to show the forecasted values alongside the actual weather data.

#9. Challenges and Considerations:
Seasonality: Weather data often exhibits complex seasonality (e.g., weekly, monthly, or yearly cycles), so it's crucial to tune the SARIMA model accordingly.
External Factors: Weather patterns are influenced by many external factors (e.g., atmospheric pressure, ocean currents). SARIMA is a univariate model, so additional variables (multivariate time series) may be considered for improving accuracy.
Model Limitations: While SARIMA is good for capturing seasonality and trends, it may not capture more complex or nonlinear patterns. In such cases, other models like machine learning-based approaches (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost) could be explored.

#10. Extensions:
After building the SARIMA model, other advanced models like SARIMAX (which includes exogenous variables) can be used to incorporate other factors like air pressure, humidity, or external weather patterns.
You could also compare SARIMA against other forecasting models, such as Prophet (from Facebook) or deep learning models like LSTM, to see which gives the best performance for your specific dataset.
